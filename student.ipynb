    "## 1.1 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The real estate industry thrives on a foundation of accurate property valuations and market analysis. In dynamic markets characterized by fierce competition, real estate agents require reliable tools to determine optimal listing prices, attract buyers quickly, and maximize profits for their sellers. The real estate market is highly competitive. Pricing homes accurately is essential for attracting buyers, maximizing profits for sellers, and ensuring timely sales Traditionally, agents may rely heavily on recent comparable sales and their own experience, which can introduce subjectivity and potential for pricing errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, limited availability of housing inventory, particularly in desirable neighborhoods or regions with high demand, can lead to increased buyer competition and inflated prices. This shortage may also result in longer wait times for buyers to find suitable properties. Meeting the diverse needs and preferences of clients, including first-time homebuyers, investors, and downsizing retirees, requires housing agents to have a deep understanding of market trends, property features, and financing options. \n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing these challenges requires collaboration and innovation within the real estate industry and proactive measures to promote affordability, fairness, and sustainability in housing markets. This project aims to provide agents with a data-driven tool to refine pricing strategies, highlight a property's most valuable assets, and offer informed recommendations for potential value-boosting renovations. \n",
    "\n",
    "A data-driven approach to property valuation can offer agents a significant edge, enabling them to make informed decisions based on market trends and property characteristics, ultimately leading to successful transactions for all parties involved."

    "### 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "The real estate market in the King County region faces challenges in accurately pricing homes, understanding the factors driving property values, and providing targeted renovation advice to homeowners. Traditional valuation methods may lack precision and fail to account for the diverse range of features influencing home prices. Consequently, real estate agents may struggle to offer accurate pricing estimates and relevant advice to clients, leading to suboptimal outcomes for both buyers and sellers.\n"
